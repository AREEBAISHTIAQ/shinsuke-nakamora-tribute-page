  <p id="tribute-info">Shinsuke Nakamura (Nakamura Shinsuke, born February 24, 1980) is a Japanese professional wrestler and former mixed martial artist. He is signed to WWE, where he performs on the SmackDown brand and is the current United States Champion in his first reign. Prior to his main roster debut, Nakamura competed in WWE's developmental brand, NXT, where he is one of only two wrestlers (along with Samoa Joe) to have held the NXT Championship on more than one occasion. In January 2018, Nakamura won the 2018 Men's Royal Rumble match.

Nakamura is perhaps best known for his work in New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), where he is a former three-time and youngest IWGP Heavyweight Champion at the age of 23, a record setting five-time and longest reigning IWGP Intercontinental Champion, a one-time IWGP Tag Team Champion (with Hiroshi Tanahashi), and the winner of the 2011 G1 Climax, 2006 G1 Tag League and 2014 New Japan Cup tournaments. Nakamura is the youngest IWGP Heavyweight Champion in history, having won the title for the first time at the age of 23 years and 9 months. In 2015, Nakamura was inducted into the Wrestling Observer Newsletter Hall of Fame.
